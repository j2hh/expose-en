	abstract = {People-Finder Systems are knowledge repositories that attempt to manage knowledge by holding pointers to experts who possess specific knowledge within an organization. This paper presents insights from the development of Expert Seeker, an organizational People-Finder KMS that will be used to locate experts at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This paper discusses insights and lessons learned from the development of this system, and the role of technology in automating the maintenance of the expert's profiles. Expert Seeker represents an important first step towards achieving our objective of automatically and intuitively discovering and identifying intellectual capital within the organization. While several systems in place today rely on self-assessment, we look at the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, in particular, data mining and clustering techniques, to uncover and map organizational expertise.},

abstract="Chapter 1 provided an overview of the basic terms and goals of experience and knowledge management. Tacit, implicit, and explicit knowledge were distinguished. The basic concepts of data, information, and knowledge were introduced and discussed. A layered model for knowledge transfer was built upon those terms. In the end, the benefit of a number of knowledge management interventions in software engineering situations was evaluated. In Chap. 2, we will look a little deeper into the theoretical foundations of knowledge management. This will provide the background for the remaining chapters.",
