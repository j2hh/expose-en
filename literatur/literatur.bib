This paper presents insights from the development of Expert Seeker, an organizational People-Finder {KMS} that will be used to locate experts at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ({NASA}). This paper discusses insights and lessons learned from the development of this system, and the role of technology in automating the maintenance of the expert's profiles. Expert Seeker represents an important first step towards achieving our objective of automatically and intuitively discovering and identifying intellectual capital within the organization. While several systems in place today rely on self-assessment, we look at the potential of artificial intelligence ({AI}) technologies, in particular, data mining and clustering techniques, to uncover and map organizational expertise.},

	abstract = {Knowledge is a broad and abstract notion that has defined epistemological debate in western philosophy since the classical Greek era. In the past few years, however, there has been a growing interest in treating knowledge as a significant organizational resource. Consistent with the interest in organizational knowledge and knowledge management ({KM}), {IS} researchers have begun promoting a class of information systems, referred to as knowledge management systems ({KMS}). The objective of {KMS} is to support creation, transfer, and application of knowledge in organizations. Knowledge and knowledge management are complex and multi-faceted concepts. Thus, effective development and implementation of {KMS} requires a foundation in several rich literatures. To be credible, {KMS} research and development should preserve and build upon the significant literature that exists in different but related fields. This paper provides a review and interpretation of knowledge management literatures in different fields with an eye toward identifying the important areas for research. We present a detailed process view of organizational knowledge management with a focus on the potential role of information technology in this process. Drawing upon the literature review and analysis of knowledge management processes, we discuss several important research issues surrounding the knowledge management processes and the role of {IT} in support of these processes.},

Reorgs can be a great way to unlock value: Two-thirds of them deliver at least some performance improvement, and with change accelerating in the business environment, they are becoming more and more common, the authors say. But most reorgs aren’t entirely successful: According to a survey conducted at {McKinsey}, more than 80\% fail to deliver the value they are supposed to in the time planned, while 10\% cause real damage to the company involved. More important, they can be miserable experiences for employees. Research suggests that reorgs—and the accompanying uncertainty about what the future holds—may cause greater stress and anxiety than layoffs, leading to noticeably reduced productivity in about 60\% of cases. That’s because the leaders of reorgs don’t specify their objectives clearly enough, miss some of the key actions (for example, focusing on reporting lines and forgetting processes and people), or do things in the wrong order (such as deciding on the way forward before assessing the strengths and weaknesses of what they have already). To help maximize the value and minimize the misery of reorgs, the authors have developed a simple five-step process for running them.},

The recognition of the need to foster the sharing of expertise has led to the development of expert finder systems that hold pointers to experts who posses specific knowledge in organisations. This paper discusses an approach to locating an expert through the application of information retrieval and analysis processes to an organization’s existing information resources, with specific reference to the engineering design domain. The approach taken was realised through an expert finder system framework. It enables the relationships of heterogeneous information sources with experts to be factored in modelling individuals’ expertise. These valuable relationships are typically ignored by existing expert finder systems, which only focus on how documents relate to their content. The developed framework also provides an architecture that can be easily adapted to different organisational environments. In addition, it also allows users to access the expertise recognition logic, giving them greater trust in the systems implemented using this framework. The framework were applied to real world application and evaluated within a major engineering company.},

	abstract = {In an Enterprise setting, an expert search system can assist users with their “expertise need” by suggesting people with relevant expertise to the topic of interest. These systems typically work by associating documentary evidence of expertise to each candidate expert, and then ranking the candidates by the extent to which the documents in their proﬁle are about the query. There are three important factors that aﬀect the retrieval performance of an expert search system - ﬁrstly, the selection of the candidate proﬁles (the documents associated with each candidate), secondly, how the topicality of the documents is measured, and thirdly how the evidence of expertise from the associated documents is combined. In this work, we investigate a new dimension to expert ﬁnding, namely whether some documents are better indicators of expertise than others in each candidate’s proﬁle. We apply ﬁve techniques to predict the quality documents in candidate proﬁles, which are likely to be good indicators of expertise. The techniques applied include the identiﬁcation of possible candidate homepages, and of clustering the documents in each proﬁle to determine the candidate’s main areas of expertise. The proposed approaches are evaluated on three expert search task from recent {TREC} Enterprise tracks and provide conclusions.},

We first construct the user question-answer interaction graph through direct semantic links and latent links extracted from the records of question sessions and user profiles. After that, two expert-finding approaches are developed by employing the semantic information in the so-called propagation link analysis method and in the language model, respectively. Experimental results on Yahoo!

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of scientific-social network integration to find a matching relationship between members of these networks (i.e. The {DBLP} publication network and the Twitter social network). This task is a crucial step toward building a multi environment expert finding system that has recently attracted much attention in Information Retrieval community. In this paper, the problem of social and scientific network integration is divided into two sub problems. The first problem concerns finding those profiles in one network, which presumably have a corresponding profile in the other network and the second problem concerns the name disambiguation to find true matching profiles among some candidate profiles for matching. Utilizing several name similarity patterns and contextual properties of these networks, we design a focused crawler to find high probable matching pairs, then the problem of name disambiguation is reduced to predict the label of each candidate pair as either true or false matching. Because the labels of these candidate pairs are not independent, state-of-the-art classification methods such as logistic regression and decision tree, which classify each instance separately, are unsuitable for this task. By defining matching dependency graph, we propose a joint label prediction model to determine the label of all candidate pairs simultaneously. Two main types of dependencies among candidate pairs are considered for designing the joint label prediction model which are quite intuitive and general. Using the discriminative approaches, we utilize various feature sets to train our proposed classifiers. An extensive set of experiments have been conducted on six test collection collected from the {DBLP} and the Twitter networks to show the effectiveness of the proposed joint label prediction model.},

This paper presents taxonomy of the task of expert finding that highlights the differences between finding experts, from the type of expertise indicator’s point of view. The taxonomy supports deep understanding of different sources of expertise information in the enterprise or online communities; for example, authored documents, emails, online posts, and social networks. In addition, different content and non-content features that characterize the evidence of expertise are discussed. The goal is to guide researchers who seek to conduct studies regarding the different types of expertise indicators and state-of-the-art techniques for expert finding in organizations or online communities. The paper concludes that although researchers have utilized a large number of graph and machine-learning techniques for locating expertise, there are still technical issues associated with the implementation of some of these methods. It also corroborates that combining content-based expertise indicators and social relationships has the benefit of alleviating some of the issues related to identifying and ranking answer experts. The above findings give implications for developing new techniques for expert finding that can overcome the technical issues associated with the performance of current methods.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Enterprise social media platforms provide new ways of sharing knowledge and communicating within organizations to benefit from the social capital and valuable knowledge that employees have. Drawing on social dilemma and self-determination theory, the purpose of this paper is to understand what factors drive employees’ participation and what factors hamper their participation in enterprise social media.

Design/methodology/approach
Based on a literature review, a unified research model is derived integrating demographic, individual, organizational and technological factors that influence the motivation of employees to share knowledge. The model is tested using statistical methods on a sample of 114 respondents in Denmark. Qualitative data are used to elaborate and explain quantitative findings.

Findings
The findings pinpoint towards the general drivers and barriers to knowledge sharing within organizations. The significant drivers to knowledge sharing are: enjoy helping others, monetary rewards, management support, management encourages and motivates knowledge sharing behavior and knowledge sharing is recognized. The significant identified barriers are: change of behavior, lack of trust and lack of time.

Practical implications
The proposed knowledge sharing framework helps to understand what factors impact engagement on social media. Furthermore, the article suggests different types of interventions to overcome the social dilemma of knowledge sharing.

Originality/value
The study contributes to an understanding of factors leading to the success or failure of enterprise social media drawing on self-determination and social dilemma theory.},

However, users are no longer able to effectively find the appropriate experts in the knowledge management system due to the complexity and diversity of the expertise and the knowledge needs. In this paper, an approach to expert recommendation is proposed to assist the user to find the required experts. The method adopts the fuzzy linguistic method to construct the expert profile, that is, to model expert’s expertise. In addition, the fuzzy text classifier is used to get the relevant degree of the document to each knowledge area when the document is registered, which is the base of the following user profile construction. Then, the user profile consisting of the time and the relevance factors of the rated documents is constructed to derive the overall knowledge needs level of the user. Consequently, the expert that fulfills the knowledge needs most is recommended based on the similarity between the derived expert profile and the user profile. The developed prototype system, “knowledge management system in aircraft industry company”, is introduced and the experimental results show the proposed approach is feasible and effective.},

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a social network-empowered research analytics framework ({RAF}) for research project selections. Scholarmate.com, a professional research social network with easy access to research relevant information, serves as a platform to build researcher profiles from three dimensions, i.e., relevance, productivity and connectivity. Building upon profiles of both proposals and researchers, we develop a unique matching algorithm to assist decision makers (e.g. panel chairs or division managers) in optimizing the assignment of reviewers to research project proposals. The proposed framework is implemented and tested by the largest government funding agency in China to aid the grant proposal evaluation process. The new system generated significant economic benefits including great cost savings and quality improvement in the proposal evaluation process.},

Relevance feedback was captured from real users engaged in {IS}\&R tasks. The feedback was used to develop a linear regression model for predicting document relevancy based on implicit relevance indicators. Fuzzy relevance profiles were created using Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency ({TF}-{IDF}) analysis for the successful user queries. Fuzzy rule based summarisation was used to integrate the three profiles into a unified index reflecting the semantic weight of the query terms related to the task, user and document. The unified index was used to select the most relevant documents and experts related to the query topic. The overall performance of the system was evaluated based on standard precision and recall metrics which show significant improvements in retrieving relevant documents in response to user queries.},

Two of the models aggregate expertise scores of the experts in the same group for the task, one locates documents associated with experts in the group and then determines how closely the documents are associated with the topic, whilst the remaining two models directly estimate the degree to which a group is a knowledgeable group for a given topic. For evaluation purposes we construct a test collection based on the {TREC} 2005 and 2006 Enterprise collections, and define three types of ground truth for our task.

	abstract = {Information seeking and integration is a complex cognitive task that consumes enormous time and effort. Inspired by the remarkable progress of Large Language Models, recent works attempt to solve this task by combining {LLMs} and search engines. However, these methods still obtain unsatisfying performance due to three challenges: (1) complex requests often cannot be accurately and completely retrieved by the search engine once (2) corresponding information to be integrated is spread over multiple web pages along with massive noise, and (3) a large number of web pages with long contents may quickly exceed the maximum context length of {LLMs}. Inspired by the cognitive process when humans solve these problems, we introduce {MindSearch} to mimic the human minds in web information seeking and integration, which can be instantiated by a simple yet effective {LLM}-based multi-agent framework. The {WebPlanner} models the human mind of multi-step information seeking as a dynamic graph construction process: it decomposes the user query into atomic sub-questions as nodes in the graph and progressively extends the graph based on the search result from {WebSearcher}. Tasked with each sub-question, {WebSearcher} performs hierarchical information retrieval with search engines and collects valuable information for {WebPlanner}. The multi-agent design of {MindSearch} enables the whole framework to seek and integrate information parallelly from larger-scale (e.g., more than 300) web pages in 3 minutes, which is worth 3 hours of human effort. {MindSearch} demonstrates significant improvement in the response quality in terms of depth and breadth, on both close-set and open-set {QA} problems. Besides, responses from {MindSearch} based on {InternLM}2.5-7B are preferable by humans to {ChatGPT}-Web and Perplexity.ai applications, which implies that {MindSearch} can already deliver a competitive solution to the proprietary {AI} search engine.},

Text preprocessing is a crucial step in converting unstructured text into a machineunderstandable format. It plays a vital role in various text classification tasks, including web search, document classification, chatbots, and virtual assistants. Techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization are carefully studied and applied in a specific order to ensure accurate and efficient information retrieval. The paper emphasizes the importance of selecting and ordering preprocessing techniques wisely to achieve high-quality results. Effective text preprocessing involves cleaning and filtering textual data to eliminate noise and enhance efficiency. Furthermore, it provides insights into the impact of different techniques, such as raw text, tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming, using a Python implementation.},

The strategy used must reﬂect the social requirements of the organisation and its assets, culture and technology. An Expertise Finder strategy must attempt to emulate the steps a member of that organisation would do to ﬁnd the answer to their questions. Our collaboration with a large manufacturing enterprise has helped us evolve an approach to building Expertise Finder systems. Our approach contains the required ﬂexibility to cope with the mix of technological, social and legacy factors that make each deployment of an Expertise Finder system very different to any other. The component based design allows a deployer to customise the basic system to utilise their relevant technical resources and then to build a unique strategy algorithm to produce a valid set of recommendations. The design produces challenging questions of how to produce a procedure for designing, deploying and evaluating the Expertise Finder strategy. This paper discusses the evolution of this design strategy and summarises our experiences to date.},

	abstract = {Expert search and profiling systems aim to identify candidate experts and rank them with respect to their estimated expertise on a given topic, using available evidence. Traditional expert search and profiling systems exploit structured data from closed systems (e.g. email program) or unstructured data from open systems (e.g. the Web). However, on today's Web, there is a growing number of data sets published according to the Linked Data principals, the majority of them being part of the Linked Open Data ({LOD}) cloud. As {LOD} connects data and people across different platforms in a meaningful way, one can assume that expert search and profiling systems would benefit from harnessing {LOD}. The work presented in this paper sets out to prove this assumption and to explore potential benefits and drawbacks of using the {LOD} cloud as expertise evidence source. We conducted several experiments to evaluate the feasibility of existing expert search and profiling approaches on a recent snapshot of the {LOD} cloud. Our findings indicate that {LOD} cloud is already a useful source for some kinds of expert search approaches (e.g., those based on publications and professional events) but still has to meet certain requirements in order to reach its full potential.},

	title = {Searchable Answer Generating Environment ({SAGE}): A Knowledge Management System for Searching for Experts in Florida},
	abstract = {The need to acquire intellectual capital created the Knowledge Management ({KM}) movement, which aims to develop new practices and tools to capture knowledge. Indepth examination of current {KM} projects revealed the largest percent of {KM} projects attempting to create some kind of a knowledge repository. Current studies identify three types of knowledge repositories. One type of knowledge repository attempts to manage organizational knowledge by storing pointers to those who have specific knowledge within the organization. In this light, this paper discusses the development of the Searchable Answer Generating Environment ({SAGE}) application. The development of this application was funded through the {NASA}/Florida Minority Institution Entrepreneurial Partnership ({FMIEP}) grant. The purpose of this application is to create a repository of experts in the State of Florida ({FL}) State University System ({SUS}). This application creates one single web-enabled repository, which can be searched in a number of ways including research topic, investigator name, funding agency, or university. {SAGE} is a repository of Intellectual Capital within the state of {FL} {SUS}; helping locate {FL} {SUS} researchers for collaboration with industry and federal agencies, thus increasing the potential for research funding to the {SUS}. {SAGE} also enhances communication and allows more visibility for {FL} {SUS} experts, making universities more marketable while combing and unifying existing data from multiple sources into one user web-accessible interface. The {SAGE} system addresses an important {KM} problem: giving a user access to distributed knowledge, through a web-based Graphical User Interface.},
