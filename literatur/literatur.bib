Nach Umsatz ist SAP das größte europäische (und außeramerikanische) sowie das weltweit drittgrößte Softwareunternehmen. Darüber hinaus handelt es sich bei SAP um das mit Abstand wertvollste börsennotierte deutsche Unternehmen.
Tätigkeitsschwerpunkt ist die Entwicklung von Software zur Abwicklung sämtlicher Geschäftsprozesse eines Unternehmens wie Buchführung, Controlling, Vertrieb, Einkauf, Produktion, Lagerhaltung, Transport und Personalwesen. Der Name SAP stand zeitweise synonym für das ehemals zentrale Softwareprodukt des Unternehmens: ein integriertes betriebswirtschaftliches Standardsoftwarepaket, auch SAP ERP genannt, zunächst in der Version SAP R/2 für Großrechner und SAP R/3 für Client-Server-Systeme. Seit 2005 engagiert sich SAP im Finanzbereich (SAP BankAnalyzer – SAP BA, SAP AFI, SAP FPSL u. a.), im Datawarehousing (SAP NetWeaver Business Intelligence) und bietet eigene Datenbanklösungen an (MaxDB, SAP ASE, SAP IQ, SAP HANA).},

	abstract = {JavaScript is a client-side programming language that can be used in multi-platform applications. It controls HTML and CSS to manipulate page behaviours and is widely used in most websites over the internet. JavaScript frameworks are structures made to help web developers build web applications faster by offering features that enhance the user interaction with the web page. An increasing number of JavaScript frameworks have been released in recent years in the market to help front-end developers build applications in a shorter space of time. Decision makers in software companies have been struggling to determine which frameworks are best suited for a specific project. This work investigates the actual state-of-the-art of JavaScript framework comparison, and it proposes metrics and methods that could help developers when choosing a JavaScript framework. In this work, a benchmark framework executes tasks to test the efficiency of three JavaScript frameworks (AngularJS, Aurelia, and Ember). The research shows the impact of the environment (CPU usage and network connectivity) on JavaScript frameworks.},

	abstract = {JavaScript programming language has been in existence for many years already and is one of the most widely known, if not, the most used front-end programming language in web development. However, JavaScript is still evolving and with the emergence of JavaScript Frameworks (JSF), there has been a major change in how developers develop software nowadays. Developers these days often use more than one framework in order to fulfil their job which has given rise to the problem for developers when it comes to choosing the right JavaScript framework to develop software which is partly due to the availability of countless numbers of JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Moreover, the use of JavaScript is getting more important for web development and thus, there has been major considerations done about the performance aspect of the JavaScript programming language. Thus, this work investigates current research regarding the comparison of JavaScript frameworks through the use of computer benchmarks. A benchmark reference application that simulates user events was developed which then incorporated the implementation of an application developed in each of the JavaScript frameworks chosen. In addition, software complexity metrics was introduced and experiments were conducted to measure these metrics. Overall, this research hopes to achieve a level of comparison which can further garner knowledge towards comparing JavaScript frameworks.},

	abstract = {Knowledge is a broad and abstract notion that has defined epistemological debate in western philosophy since the classical Greek era. In the past few years, however, there has been a growing interest in treating knowledge as a significant organizational resource. Consistent with the interest in organizational knowledge and knowledge management (KM), IS researchers have begun promoting a class of information systems, referred to as knowledge management systems (KMS). The objective of KMS is to support creation, transfer, and application of knowledge in organizations. Knowledge and knowledge management are complex and multi-faceted concepts. Thus, effective development and implementation of KMS requires a foundation in several rich literatures. To be credible, KMS research and development should preserve and build upon the significant literature that exists in different but related fields. This paper provides a review and interpretation of knowledge management literatures in different fields with an eye toward identifying the important areas for research. We present a detailed process view of organizational knowledge management with a focus on the potential role of information technology in this process. Drawing upon the literature review and analysis of knowledge management processes, we discuss several important research issues surrounding the knowledge management processes and the role of IT in support of these processes.},

The recognition of the need to foster the sharing of expertise has led to the development of expert finder systems that hold pointers to experts who posses specific knowledge in organisations. This paper discusses an approach to locating an expert through the application of information retrieval and analysis processes to an organization’s existing information resources, with specific reference to the engineering design domain. The approach taken was realised through an expert finder system framework. It enables the relationships of heterogeneous information sources with experts to be factored in modelling individuals’ expertise. These valuable relationships are typically ignored by existing expert finder systems, which only focus on how documents relate to their content. The developed framework also provides an architecture that can be easily adapted to different organisational environments. In addition, it also allows users to access the expertise recognition logic, giving them greater trust in the systems implemented using this framework. The framework were applied to real world application and evaluated within a major engineering company.},

Reorgs can be a great way to unlock value: Two-thirds of them deliver at least some performance improvement, and with change accelerating in the business environment, they are becoming more and more common, the authors say. But most reorgs aren’t entirely successful: According to a survey conducted at McKinsey, more than 80\% fail to deliver the value they are supposed to in the time planned, while 10\% cause real damage to the company involved. More important, they can be miserable experiences for employees. Research suggests that reorgs—and the accompanying uncertainty about what the future holds—may cause greater stress and anxiety than layoffs, leading to noticeably reduced productivity in about 60\% of cases. That’s because the leaders of reorgs don’t specify their objectives clearly enough, miss some of the key actions (for example, focusing on reporting lines and forgetting processes and people), or do things in the wrong order (such as deciding on the way forward before assessing the strengths and weaknesses of what they have already). To help maximize the value and minimize the misery of reorgs, the authors have developed a simple five-step process for running them.},
