\section{Objectives and Research Question} 
The goal of this project is the conception as well as the development of a prototype for a  
contact management tool. This objective can be broken down into the following sub-goals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Requirement analysis: In the first part of the project, the goal will be to gather 
    information and documenting the individual requirements of the Telekom field-operations 
    team regarding the contact management system, as they will be the ones involved in testing later on.  
    \item Design of the prototype: The second part of the project will focus on the design and 
    conception of the prototype. There, a combination of functional but also user-friendly design 
    will be the main target. On the one hand it should be possible to find the right contacts for a given
    problem in a variety of ways, on the other hand the possibility to maintain and manage contact data 
    should be given.
    \item Implementation and testing of the prototype: The third and final part of the project has
    the sub-goal to develop and test the previously designed prototype. Tests will include usability
    as well as functionality aspects.
\end{itemize}
The project won't focus on long-term implications. Also, security aspects will mostly be ignored. 
The main focus will be on the functionality and usability of the tool.
