\section{State of Research} 

In recent years, contact management systems or People-Finder Systems, a special form of knowledge management systems, have become increasingly 
important due to the rise of digitalization and the need to optimize internal processes. People-Finder Systems are specialized 
Systems that help in the process of finding the right contacts by linking specific keywords and topics with fitting experts \cite{becerra-fernandez_facilitating_nodate}.
Some real-world examples of People-Finder Systems are Expertise Finder \cite{noauthor_expertise_nodate} or Expertfile \cite{noauthor_expertfile_nodate}, which are web 
applications that help to find experts in a specific field.\\ \\
Some more general information can be found in the field of knowledge management systems. Here, works like "Knowledge Management in Organizations: A Critical Introduction" \cite{hislop2018knowledge} and "Fundamental Concepts of Knowledge Management" \cite{Schneider2009} 
provide a good overview of the field.\\ \\
What has not been researched as much is the field of contact management solutions fitted for dynamic and agile working environments. Also usability and user-friendliness are often neglected in the development of such systems.
This is where this project tries to offer a solution by developing a prototype to address those problems.\\
